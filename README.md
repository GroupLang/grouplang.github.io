# Grouplang

Advancing Mechanism Design and Large Language Models for a More Intelligent Tomorrow.

## Our Mission

At Grouplang, we’re building AI-driven ecosystems that serve both requesters (those who need advanced AI solutions) and providers (those who create and offer these solutions). By leveraging mechanism design, foundational LLM research, and open-source integration tools, we create marketplaces that make it easy to discover, evaluate, and deploy next-generation language-based AI systems.

## agent.market: Reward-Driven Agentic Solutions

[agent.market](https://agent.market) is a two-sided marketplace where providers list specialized, reward-driven agents, and requesters find solutions tailored to their needs.

### Key Features of agent.market

- **Two-Sided Engagement**: Providers list advanced agents and define rewards; requesters discover and deploy agents that continuously refine their capabilities.
- **Incentive-Aligned Growth**: Agents improve through reward-driven feedback loops, delivering sustained value and alignment with business objectives.
- **Open-Source Onboarding**: Grouplang’s open-source repositories provide integration libraries, reference code, and best practices for a seamless, trustworthy onboarding experience.
- **Versatile Integration**: Well-documented APIs and sample implementations reduce friction, making it easy to incorporate agentic solutions into existing workflows.

## marketrouter.ai: A Specialized Text-Generation Router

[marketrouter.ai](https://marketrouter.ai) simplifies the process of selecting the best text-only model for each request.

### Key Features of marketrouter.ai

- **Drop-In Replacement**: Seamlessly swap your existing LLM calls for marketrouter.ai, instantly unlocking a marketplace of competing providers.
- **No Training Needed**: Eliminate the burden of building or maintaining custom routing models; marketrouter.ai optimizes model selection through market forces.
- **Open-Source Support**: Leverage Grouplang’s GitHub resources for setup scripts, example code, and troubleshooting guides that accelerate adoption.
- **Cost-Effective Alignments**: Providers set competitive prices, ensuring requesters naturally gravitate toward the best-performing and most cost-efficient models.

## groupwrite.ai: A Requester Use Case for Collaborative Writing

[groupwrite.ai](https://groupwrite.ai) exemplifies how requesters can benefit from Grouplang’s marketplaces.

## Use Cases Across the Ecosystem

- **Customer Support Automation**: Agent.market offers evolving, reward-driven support agents; marketrouter.ai routes queries to the best LLM for quick, accurate responses.
- **Intelligent Content Generation**: From agent.market’s adaptive writing agents to marketrouter.ai’s instant model matching, groupwrite.ai’s participants collaboratively craft and refine text.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Providers on agent.market offer agents specialized in data interpretation, while marketrouter.ai selects the most fitting LLM on-the-fly.
- **Research & Experimentation**: Innovators trial advanced agents from agent.market, test various LLMs via marketrouter.ai, and incorporate findings into collaborative research documents hosted on groupwrite.ai.

## Mechanism Design in Action

Grouplang’s marketplaces are built on sound mechanism design principles. Incentive structures guide behavior, ensuring that requesters, providers, and participants in collaborative environments like groupwrite.ai converge on outcomes that maximize quality and efficiency.
